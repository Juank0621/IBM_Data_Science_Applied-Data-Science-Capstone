# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Applied Data Science Capstone offered by IBM. The objective is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX advertises the cost of Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, significantly lower than the $165+ million charged by other providers. The primary reason for this cost efficiency is the reusability of the Falcon 9 first stage. By determining the likelihood of a successful landing, this project aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of launches and provide insights for potential competitors looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection and Wrangling**:
   - Extract and clean data from SpaceX and other relevant sources.
   - Format datasets for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identify trends and correlations in the data.
   - Visualize key features affecting landing success.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Select and engineer features to improve prediction accuracy.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Build machine learning models to predict landing success.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
